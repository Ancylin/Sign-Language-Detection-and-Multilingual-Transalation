Effective communication is essential for full participation in society, yet individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing often face significant barriers due to a lack of accessible tools for real-time interaction. This project introduces an Enhanced Real-Time Sign Language Recognition and Multilingual Translation System designed to bridge this communication gap using state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system captures and interprets sign language gestures in real time and translates them into both spoken and written formats across multiple languages. It employs TensorFlow’s MoveNet, a highly efficient pose estimation model, to track and extract human body key points particularly hand and arm movements crucial for sign language recognition. The extracted pose data is processed through an ensemble of deep neural networks, combining ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and InceptionNetV3 architectures. This ensemble approach significantly improves gesture classification accuracy by leveraging the strengths of each model through a weighted voting mechanism. Once a gesture is recognized, the corresponding text output is translated into the user’s preferred language using the Google Translate API. For added accessibility, the translated text is also converted to audio using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library. All functionalities are integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit interface, which allows users to interact with the system via real-time webcam input, static images, or uploaded video files. The system achieves a gesture recognition accuracy of 98.5% making it suitable for real-time applications. It is designed to run on standard computing devices without the need for specialized hardware, ensuring cost-effectiveness and wide accessibility.This solution is highly applicable across multiple domains. In summary, this project provides a robust, real-time solution for sign language recognition and multilingual translation. By combining deep learning, real-time processing, and user-centric design, it offers a practical and scalable approach to improving accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies.
